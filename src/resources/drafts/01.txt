Examples of WHEN

When did the American Civil War begin? => triggers a lookup for 'date/time' using simple-internet-lookup
The detective asked me when I last saw her. => doesn't indicate we need to take action
When is the next performance? => triggers a lookup in our internal database, probably the agenda to start with
It was a time when people didn't have to lock their doors. => notes that there was a time in human history when 'people' didn't...
the happy days when we were together => indicates a (happy, sentiment) time when this person was with (together) another person (we)

We're still waiting for the test results, when we'll decide our next move. =>
``Ok this was pretty hard for me to get actually`` e.g.
1) So what will you do?
2) I'll have to see, perhaps use some other criteria since We're still waiting for the test results, when we'll decide our next move.
2) So we'll have to use some other information to decide upon.
